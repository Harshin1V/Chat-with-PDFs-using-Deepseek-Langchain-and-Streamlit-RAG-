# Chat with PDFs using Deepseek, Langchain and Streamlit(RAG)

- Built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using Deepseek, LangChain, and Streamlit to chat with PDFs and answer complex questions about your local documents.
- Using Ollama's Deepseek-r1 llm model, which features strong **reasoning capabilities** , integrating it with a **LangChain-powered RAG,** and then showing you how to use a simple **Streamlit** interface so you can query your PDFs in real time.
